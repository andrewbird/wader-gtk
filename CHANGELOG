This is a new minor stable release of Wader. List of changes:

* wader-core

      causes conflicts with the stock NetworkManager.

    * Start and restart scripts merged into one: wader-core-ctl

* wader-gtk
    * Fix PUK/PUK2 handling, see #148

Overview of changes since Wader-0.3.1
=====================================

This is a new minor stable release of Wader. List of changes:

    * NetworkManager compatibility has been temporally disabled, our
    three target distros ship with different snapshots of NM/MM and
    they don't include some later patches required for compatibility.

    that we are connected and it will insist on that we are disconnected. A
    simple workaround is to check the "Work offline" checkbox in "File".
